#### Overview

##### Import from DashDB

This example retrieves data from a dashDB database and saves it to HDFS.  This example is run by gradle and using ssh:

 1. create a temporary folder in the user's home folder on the cluster
 1. download db2 jdbc jar files from the cluster to the local build environment
 2. upload db2 jdbc jar files and spark script from the local build environment to the temporary user's folder on the cluster
 3. create a hdfs folder for storing the data imported from dashdb
 4. execute pyspark to import the data and copy it to hdfs
 5. cat the file created on hdfs to view its output
 6. cleanup by removing the hdfs folder and the temporary user's folder on the cluster

Take a look at the [build.gradle](./build.gradle) file, starting with the Example task defintion `task('Example') { ... }`  and then move on to the spark script [importfromdashdb.py](./importfromdashdb.py) to see exactly what is being done.

##### Export from DashDB

This example retrieves data from a dashDB sample schema and saves it to the user's schema using spark.  This example is run by gradle and using ssh:

 1. create a temporary folder in the user's home folder on the cluster
 1. download db2 jdbc jar files from the cluster to the local build environment
 2. upload db2 jdbc jar files and spark script from the local build environment to the temporary user's folder on the cluster
 3. create a table for exporting the data to
 4. execute pyspark to import the data and export it again
 5. verify some data was exported
 6. cleanup by removing the temporary folders and tables

Take a look at the [build.gradle](./build.gradle) file, starting with the Example task defintion `task('Example') { ... }`  and then move on to the spark script [exporttodashdb.py](./exporttodashdb.py) to see exactly what is being done.

#### Instructions

*NOTE:*

Basic clusters do not have the jar files available.  As a workaround, manually obtain a copy of the following jars and place them in the 'downloads' folder.  See [here](https://github.com/snowch/biginsight-examples/issues/17) for more info.

- db2jcc.jar
- db2jcc4.jar
- db2jcc_license_cu.jar

Ensure you have followed the Setup Instructions on the [project home page README](https://github.com/snowch/biginsight-examples), then edit your connection.properties file so that it has a property `dashdb_pull_jdbc_url` that points to your dashDB account:

```
dashdb_pull_jdbc_url:jdbc:db2://changeme:50001/BLUDB:user=changeme;password=changeme;sslConnection=true;
```

Run this example by changing into the current directory then executing:

- on *nix using:

```
../../gradlew ExamplePull
../../gradlew ExamplePush
```

- on Windows using:

```
../../gradlew.bat ExamplePull
../../gradlew.bat ExamplePush
```

*********************************************************************

Note: you can run this script from the top level project folder using the gradle `-p` argument:

```
./gradlew -p examples/DashDBPullWithSpark ExamplePull
./gradlew -p examples/DashDBPullWithSpark ExamplePush
```
